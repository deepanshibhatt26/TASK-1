Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
I cleaned a pharma sales dataset with around 100 entries. First, I filled the missing age values using the middle (median) age. Then, I removed duplicate rows. I fixed gender entries by changing all forms like “M”, “male”, “FEMALE” into just “Male” or “Female”. I also made all country names the same, like changing “UK” and “United Kingdom” to “United Kingdom”, and “us” or “USA” to “United States”. The dates were written in different ways, so I used Excel tools to convert them into one format: dd-mm-yyyy. Lastly, I made the column names simple and clear. Now the data is clean and ready to use.
